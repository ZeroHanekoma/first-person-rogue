# WIP First Person Dungeon Crawler

Weird little project I started.  Currently not working on it but may come back at some point because I think conceptually it's neat.

## Basic Concept
Randomly generated, like the original Rogue.  Everything I can randomly generate, I will.  Game is entirely turn based.
You can pick one of several Races, and one of Several Classes.
Level your stats, skills, get abilities, magic.

No open world, just keep going deeper and deeper into the dungeon until you die.

You can kill things, or chat with them.  Further interactions pending.

### Features Implemented

- Factions with different relationships (sometimes they fight!)
- Enemy Line of Sight
- Randomly Generated Classes
- Dungeon Backstory and Name! (means nothing)
